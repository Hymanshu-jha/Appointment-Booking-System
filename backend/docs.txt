first we will implement deleivering status 
---
[1] whenever an appointment is scheduled successfully then after receiving stripe webhook
then immediately inside that route handler only, add a job to bullmq queue, (appointmentId),
appointmentTime
and this job will be 'scheduled' at time = appointmentTime and Appointment.find(appointmentId).
status = 'deleivering'
but we must check at the time of updation from worker js, that appointment status must be 'scheduled'
and paymentStatus = 'succeeded'


appointment completion status 
---
[2] whenever an appointment is scheduled successfully from webhook route handler, we will immediately 
add a job to the queue , appointmentId, appointmentTime+serviceTime, 
at time =  appointmentTime+serviceTime
worker bullmq will check if status = 'deleivering'
then update status = 'completed'
5 minutes, 2 minutes and 1 minute before completion time only if appointment.status = 'deleivering', 
we will give reminders in webApp itself
